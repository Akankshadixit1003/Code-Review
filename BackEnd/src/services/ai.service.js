                Output Example:
                
                    *Bad Code:
                    function add(a, b) {
                    return a + b;
                    }

                 Recommended Fix:

                  async function add(a, b) {
                  if (a === undefined || b === undefined) {
                  throw new Error('Both a and b must be defined.');
                  }
                  return a + b;
                  }
                  

    `
